# Template Archive Directory

This directory contains older versions of templates that have been migrated to the new component-based template structure. These files are kept for reference but are not part of the active template system.

## Directory Structure

- **old_templates/**: Contains the original flat template files
  - Includes old versions of pages such as `clasificacion.html`, `pesaje.html`, etc.
  - Standalone PDF templates like `clasificacion_pdf_template.html`, `pesaje_pdf_template.html`
  - Print view templates like `clasificacion_print_view.html`, `pesaje_print_view.html`

- **backup/**: Contains backup files with `.bak_url` extensions
  - These were created during the URL refactoring process

## Purpose

These files are maintained for:
1. Historical reference
2. Understanding the evolution of the UI
3. Troubleshooting if needed

**Note**: The current active templates use a component-based structure with layouts, components, and blueprint-specific templates. This approach provides better reusability and maintainability.
